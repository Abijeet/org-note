OrgNote is a small application that allows you to categorize your notes.

Each category is represented as a seperate folder and each note is a text 
file inside that folder. 

Another small feature of the application is that it allows you to export a 
category and all the files in it into HTML, which then can be viewed on a 
browser.

OrgNote stores it's data in the home directory of the user, inside a folder
named OrgNote.

I have compiled and run the program on a 64 bit Linux machine. The application 
uses Qt so it should be platform independent. I am still working on this, and 
it's in an alpha stage

I designed the application using QtCreator. Download the files and run 
'qmake -project' in a terminal with cwd set to the folder containing these 
files. Then add the .pro file generated to your QtCreator to load the project.
